## E-Commerce Group Project

This is our group project for the CS2TP module.  
We are a fully functional e-commerce platform with both **customer** and **admin** interfaces.

##  Project Overview

The goal is to design, build, and deploy a website that allows customers to:
- Register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- Browse products by category, search, and filter.
- Add products to a basket, checkout, and view orders.
- Leave ratings and reviews for products.

Admins can:
- Manage users, products, and orders.
- Track stock levels and sales reports.
- Process shipments and handle inventory updates.
